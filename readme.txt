The plugin makes it easy to add a price in the second currency. US dollars-Japanese Yen (planning to add more currencies) are automatically converted.

===================================================================

== Description ==

When money notations appear in your posts/page text, this plugin detects and adds the converted amount in foreign currency.

For now, this plugin only works between Japanese Yen and US dollars, in English and Japanese.

For example, sentence like "It costs $350." would be "It costs $350(32,854 Japanese yen)."

The conversion is looking up the latest foreign exchange rates.

For bloggers who already did such conversion manually, the plugin has an option to set a date only after when the conversion works.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Some numbers are not detected. What are limitations? =

 - number in text are not detected. For example,
   - twenty dollars
   - few thousand dollars
   - a couple of dollars
 - numbers bigger than billion are not handled
 - billion/trillion are in US style, not UK style (because it can not be supported both notations simultaneously)

= How are Japanese zenkaku digits handled? =

 All Japanese zenkaku digits are converted, then checked and filtered. Because of that, all digits in the text, even though they are not money related, will be converted with regular ASCII digits.
